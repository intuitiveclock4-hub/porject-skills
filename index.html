    <section id="research" class="section">
      <h3>What we researched</h3>
      <p>We explored wellbeing through secondary sources, student surveys, and visual design. Each method helped us understand what students need most.</p>
      <div class="grid-3">

        <!-- SECONDARY -->
        <article class="card secondary-box">
          <h4>Secondary Research</h4>
          <p>We reviewed mental health websites and wellbeing studies. Key topics included causes of stress, effects on students, and school-based solutions. We found that students thrive when they feel safe, supported, and connected to their school community.</p>

        <!-- PRIMARY -->
        <article class="card primary-box">
          <h4>Primary Research</h4>
          <p>We surveyed students and teachers across years 5–10. Students shared how they cope with stress, what support they need, and what schools are doing well. The most common stressors were exams and social pressure. Students valued talking to someone, taking breaks, and having flexible deadlines.</p>

        <!-- DESIGN -->
        <article class="card design-box">
          <h4>Design Ideas</h4>
          <p>We created a wellbeing app prototype called “B” with posters to promote it. The app includes a wellbeing tracker, anonymous feedback, and daily check-ins. Posters introduce the app, explain its features, and share testimonials from beta testers. We also designed a flowchart showing how students, teachers, and schools interact with the app to improve wellbeing.</p>
